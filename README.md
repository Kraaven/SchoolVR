# Premise

In respect to India HCI (SDC submission) and Smart India Hackathon. Our team decided to make an interactive social learning Aid.


## My Contribution

After a lot of [research](https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/proj/dollar/qdollar.html), i created a $P like recognision system to recognise multi-strokes in mid air to fire an event spawning a 3D model. In the sense of scaling, i wrote the code to allow efficient scaling and potentially make the project much larger, allowing for serialization of strokes and even possibly download _asset packs_ from online. (In inspiration to my walmart interactive project).
